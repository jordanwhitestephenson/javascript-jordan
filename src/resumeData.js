    "roleDescription": "With experience working across an array(pun intended!) of full stack web technologies, I have real passion for design and seemless user experience. I am Denver-lover and an absolute technology geek. I love geeking out on all things JavaScript and React. I have a high passion for building user-focused websites and always wanting to learn more. As a former NCAA Oklahoma State Team Captain, I thrive on teamwork and grit. Coding has everything I love: structure, analysis, language, logic, creativity and intellectual stimulation. As a self-proclaimed challenge-junkie, I am always on the look out for new technologies to learn, hackathons to attend, and new fourteeners to conquer..",
